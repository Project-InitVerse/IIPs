# Abstract

This proposal aims to establish ViaC DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization based on but not limited to InitVerse INIChian. Through a hierarchical governance structure, a hybrid voting mechanism, and a governance mining system, it realizes in-depth collaboration among miners, developers, and community members. Promote the construction of distributed urban communities in the InitVerse ecosystem. The core design includes:

1. Dual-track governance structure (core committee + Professional committee)
2. VAC Points and Inboo NFT Dual-track Incentive System (Optional)
3. Contributor Hierarchy and Brand Empowerment Rules (Expandable

# Motivation and Background

##  1. Problem statement
The current InitVerse ecosystem is facing the following challenges and opportunities:
- The ecological governance system is not yet complete: In the early stage of the main network launch of the current affiliated public chain, development decisions overly rely on the core team, lacking the participation of miners and the community.
- The incentive system has taken shape: The existing mechanism has covered miners (YatesPool) and developers (Grants), but it is difficult to quantify community contributions.

##  2. Design Objectives
- Decentralized collaboration: Achieving the common development and governance of miners, developers, and community members through DAO;
- Economic binding mechanism: Bind contributions, community activities and governance to reduce the risk of evil deeds;
- Scalability: The hierarchical structure supports the addition, deletion, and modification of DAO members;

# Design principle
- Hierarchical governance: The strategic layer (core committee) and the executive layer (professional committee) are separated to balance efficiency and decentralization.
- Miner Priority: Safeguard rights and interests through mechanisms such as computing power contribution and hardware residual value management.
- Quantifiable contribution: The VAC points system converts behaviors such as social media interaction and event organization into on-chain incentives.
- Progressive delegation of power: Initially, governance is led by the core team, and gradually transitions to full community-driven.

# Technical Specification

## 1. Governance structure
### 1.1 Dual-track governance structure
Core Committee (Strategic Level)
- It is composed of 5 to 15 members, including representatives of the ViaC_Dao team, the community core Builder (i.e., L4 Builder), and representatives of the INI public chain team, and is generated through multiple criteria such as initial default, token staking, and community voting.
- Responsibilities: At the initial stage of the ecosystem, it is expected that diversified businesses will emerge successively. Subsequently, participate in organizing community activities, expand the community scale, formulate mining pool allocation strategies, assist in technological upgrades, manage the vault, etc.

Professional Committee (Executive Level)
- Technical Committee: Responsible for optimizing open-source tools, assisting in contract security audits, etc.
- Risk Control Committee: Monitor 51% attack risks;
- Ecological Committee: Manage the residual value of mining hardware, etc.
- Review Committee: Filter low-quality proposals or others;

### 1.2 Member Access Mechanism
- Technical threshold: Candidates need to pass on-chain proficiency testing.
- Economic constraints: If necessary, enforce the lock-up governance of the token INI, and malicious behavior will trigger token confiscation (through a referendum).
- Dynamic rotation: Double-quarter rotation to eliminate members who commit evil deeds;
- Election mechanism: It is temporarily composed of representatives from the public chain team and the ViaC_Dao team, and DAO representatives will be added successively.

##  2. Decision-making and Incentive Mechanism
### 2.1 Mixed Voting
- Conventional decision-making: By adopting delegation, DAO members entrust their voting rights to Kols or Builder L4 representatives to lower the threshold.
- Major matter: Second vote to prevent manipulation by interest alliances;

### 2.2 Governance of the mining system
- Incentive points - $VAC: Vouchers that can be used for hardware (mining machines), etc.
- Incentive NFT - Inboo: The official NFT of InitVerse, which can be used for task rewards. Its benefits include potential secondary market circulation value, expected airdrops of ecosystem projects, and vouchers for exchanging hardware (mining machines), etc.
- Airdrop method: DAO members submit their contribution records (as well as the amount of VAC and NFT they are entitled to) through the contribution form. VAC points are airdropped to the corresponding main network INI address through the smart contract. Contract address: TBD; The Inboo NFT was airdropped to the corresponding mainnet INI address;

##  3. Points Board
| Contributor Level | Accumulate VAC points levels | Phased incentive | Brand empowerment
| -- | -- | -- | --| 
| L1 | >= 1,000 | 1. Get the time of InitVerse team members and communicate Face to Face; 2. Jointly plan and implement activities with ViaC_Dao event organizers on a paid basis; 3. Obtain opportunities for resource connection (depending on the situation);  | L1 generally does not use the InitVerse and ViaC_Dao brands.| 
| L2 | >= 5,000 | Inboo Rare NFT * 1, Mint is expected to consume $INI | Activities can be organized using the InitVerse and ViaC_Dao brand resources after the application.| 
| L3 | >= 10,000 | Inboo Epic NFT * 1, Mint is expected to consume $INI | Open the construction authority of ViaC_Dao distributed urban communities;  Obtain official brand resource support, depending on the specific circumstances.| 
| L4 | >= 20,000 | Inboo Legendary NFT * 1, Mint is expected to consume $INI | Open the construction authority of ViaC_Dao distributed urban communities;  Obtain official brand resource support, depending on the specific circumstances.|

- ViaC_Dao TG Builder Group, the core Builder of ViaC Dao, helps expand INIChain nodes and participates in the planning and execution of ecological activities, etc.
- Collaborate with community-based DAO organizations to organize developmental activities and resource exchanges, increasing the size of community members and the influence of the InitVerse brand.

# Theoretical basis and advantages and disadvantages
##  1. Theoretical support
- Dynamic rotation: Enhance governance flexibility based on the "Liquid Democracy" model.
##  2. Potential risks
- Governance delay: Hybrid voting may lead to a decline in decision-making efficiency.
​​
# Implementation plan
- Phase 1 (0-1 month) : Initiate the core committee and deploy the VAC credit contract;
- Phase 2 (1-6 months) : Initiate the professional committee, open Inboo NFT minting, and pilot the construction of distributed communities;
- Phase 3 (6-12 months) : Release the initial team representative seats and transition to community autonomy.
​​
# Conclusion
ViaC_DAO provides a quantifiable collaboration framework for miners, developers, and community members through hierarchical governance and dual-track incentive design. Its core value lies in the deep integration of hardware computing power, social media contributions, and on-chain governance, establishing a reusable DAO paradigm for the Web3 distributed urban ecosystem.
