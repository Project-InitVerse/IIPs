## Abstract

This proposal aims to define a standardized process for InitVerse Improvement Proposals (IIP), providing the community with a consistent and transparent proposal mechanism to ensure that all proposals are processed and implemented efficiently.

## Motivation

As the InitVerse network continues to evolve, the community and developers have submitted numerous suggestions for system improvements, upgrades, and governance changes. In order to efficiently and fairly evaluate and implement these suggestions, it is necessary to establish a unified IIP proposal process. The goal of this proposal is to provide a standardized framework for all IIPs, ensuring that the proposal contents are clear, transparent, and traceable.

## Specification

### IIP Types

IIPs are categorized into the following types, each with different purposes and applicable scopes:

#### Technical Standards IIP (ITP)

This type of proposal involves technical changes that affect the InitVerse protocol, including but not limited to network protocols, consensus mechanisms, transaction validity, API standards, etc. These proposals can be further divided into:

- **Core and Interface Specifications**: Includes consensus algorithm improvements, network protocol upgrades, etc.
- **Application Standard Specifications**: Includes token standards, interface standards, etc.

#### Organizational IIP (IOP)

This type of proposal deals with improvements to InitVerse's governance, processes, and procedures, such as changes to governance structures, decision-making processes, and permission management, but does not involve technical or codebase changes.

#### Guideline IIP (IGP)

This type of proposal provides guidance on the design, architecture, or methodologies related to InitVerse, helping community members understand the project's direction and decision-making standards. It usually does not involve the implementation of new features.

### IIP Creation Process

- **Idea**: The initial stage of a proposal, where any community member can propose an idea and discuss it in the designated discussion area. Once a feasible solution is discussed, it will be proposed to the IIP repository as a draft.

- **Draft**: After the initial discussion is approved, the proposal moves into the draft stage. The draft will be formatted by the IIP editorial team and submitted to the IIP repository for further review.

- **Review**: The draft enters the review stage, where the proposal undergoes technical and logical review by the community and professional development teams to ensure feasibility and alignment with the networkâ€™s long-term goals.

- **Final**: Once the proposal is approved during the review stage, it enters the final stage and becomes an official InitVerse standard, implemented during the relevant version updates.

- **Stagnant**: If an IIP proposal remains inactive for over a year, it enters a stagnant state. The stagnant state lasts for two years, and if the author does not reactivate it within this period, the proposal will be withdrawn.

- **Withdrawn**: A proposal can be withdrawn by the author, or if a proposal remains stagnant for more than two years, it will be automatically withdrawn. If a withdrawn proposal is re-submitted, it will go through the proposal process again as a new proposal.

- **Living**: This type of proposal is continually updated over time and remains in a dynamic state. For example, IIP1, which is continuously modified based on community feedback and needs.

## Rationale

This proposal provides a standardized process for managing and advancing community suggestions efficiently and transparently. It addresses the current lack of clarity and consistency in the proposal process, fostering better community consensus and decision-making transparency. By offering this structure, the proposal ensures that proposers, reviewers, and implementers clearly understand their roles and responsibilities.

## Backward Compatibility

This proposal itself does not involve any technical changes and therefore does not affect backward compatibility. It only provides a structured framework for future proposals.

## Security Considerations

This proposal primarily addresses the standardization of the proposal process, so it does not directly impact the security of the system. However, a clearer proposal process will facilitate more rigorous technical reviews, reducing the risk of potential security vulnerabilities.

## Reference Implementation

The implementation of this proposal will be carried out by the community following the standardized process. All IIPs will be submitted, reviewed, and evaluated according to this document, and the development team will conduct the technical review and deployment.

## Appendix

None

## Naming and Numbering Rules

- Each IIP proposal will be assigned a number by the platform; authors do not need to manually fill in the number.
- The file naming format will be `iip-<number>.md`, such as `iip-001.md`.
- All IIPs must be submitted to the official IIP repository for community review.

## Proposal Guidelines

- Proposers should review existing IIPs to avoid duplication.
- All proposals must be written in English.
- Technical proposals should include verifiable code or implementation drafts.
- Governance proposals must clearly define the executing entity, permission boundaries, and voting mechanisms.

## Community Participation

- IIP proposals can be discussed on the InitVerse forum, GitHub Issues, and Discord channels.
- The review committee consists of core developers, validator representatives, and community members.
- All voting results should be public and recorded on-chain.

Through this proposal, we aim to establish a clear, transparent, and efficient process for proposals, fostering collaboration and interaction between community members, developers, and the governance structure, and promoting the healthy and sustainable development of the InitVerse network.
