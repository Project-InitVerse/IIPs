## Introduction

This proposal recommends adjustments to the InitVerse Mainnet PoW consensus parameters, including shortening the block time, lowering the per-block reward, and correspondingly extending the reward halving cycle. The goal is to enhance network performance and accelerate transaction confirmation speeds while keeping the total daily block rewards and halving rhythm unchanged, thereby maintaining the stability of the network’s economic model.

---

## Motivation

The current block time is 30 seconds, which limits transaction confirmation speed. Under high network load, user experience degrades.

By reducing block time to 10 seconds, this proposal aims to significantly improve the network’s transaction processing capacity and responsiveness. To prevent an excessive annual token issuance caused by increased block frequency, it also proposes lowering the per-block reward and extending the halving cycle, ensuring the overall issuance curve remains consistent with the original design.

## Specification Changes

| Parameter         | Current Value              | Proposed Value              |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Block Time         | 30 seconds               | 10 seconds                   |
| Per-Block reward         |  ~780 INI           | ~227 INI               |
| Halving Cycle     | Every 20,160 blocks      | Every 60,480 blocks        |

Notes:
60,480 blocks ≈ 7 days (based on 10-second block time), maintaining a weekly halving rhythm;
The per-block reward is reduced to approximately one-third to offset the increased issuance due to faster blocks;
This adjustment has no significant impact on the overall annual inflation rate.

---

## Technical Implementation Suggestions

Change consensus rule parameter `BLOCK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to `10`;
Set `BlockReward` to `227 INI`;
Change  `epoch`  to `60480`;
Recommend activating via mainnet block height, for example, `at Block Height 564,480 (which would be the 28th halving; current height is 534099, expected in 10 days)`.

## Compatibility Notes
This proposal involves changes at the consensus layer and requires all full nodes and miners on the network to upgrade. Recommendations:

Announce the upgrade 5 days in advance;
Update the blockchain explorer and mining pool interface;
No impact on on-chain historical data or legacy data structures.

## Security Impact Assessment
Potential impacts:
Improved network throughput will enhance dApp and wallet transaction experiences.
