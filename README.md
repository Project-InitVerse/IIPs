# InitVerse Improvement Protocol

The **InitVerse Improvement Protocol** outlines the fundamental governance principles for the InitVerse network. It defines the technical development direction, organizational structure proposals, core protocol specifications for network recovery, and related technical and operational standards. This protocol also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.

## IIP Design Principles

The **IIP** is designed to guide the InitVerse network and community in following a set of standardized principles for healthy growth. Every network or mechanism change should be fully discussed to realize the goal of community governance and to help InitVerse grow and evolve efficiently.

## Types of IIPs

IIPs are categorized into several types, each with its corresponding list:

### Technical Standards IIPs (InitVerse Technical Proposals, ITPs)

These describe various changes that impact InitVerse, including network protocol compilation, changes to block or transaction validity rules, application standard proposals, or any changes or additions that affect the interoperability of programs built on InitVerse. These are further divided into:

#### Core and Interface Specifications

Includes improvements to:
- Consensus algorithms
- Networking
- Block or transaction validity
- Client API/RPC specifications
- Language-level standards

#### Application Standards

Includes application-level standards and conventions such as:
- Token standards
- Similar implementations

### Organizational IIPs (InitVerse Organizational Proposals, IOPs)

These proposals allow the community to suggest, discuss, and achieve consensus on governance matters. They may define procedures, guidelines, or changes in decision-making processes. **IOPs do not affect the InitVerse codebase directly.**

### Guidance IIPs (InitVerse Guidance Proposals, IGPs)

These provide recommendations regarding InitVerse’s design, architecture, or organizational structure, or offer general guidance to the InitVerse community. While they do not introduce new features, they present conceptual directions or frameworks that developers and community members can choose to follow.

## IIP Lifecycle

- **Idea**: A pre-draft concept. Any user may propose an idea and discuss it in the IIP discussion forum. Once a feasible solution emerges, it can be formally proposed into the IIP repository.

- **Draft**: A concept that has passed initial discussion. It is merged into the repository by an IIP Editor for further voting and review.

- **Review**: Drafts enter a peer review phase, involving the InitVerse community and professional development teams.

- **Final**: After successfully passing review, the IIP becomes an official InitVerse standard (IRC) and will be implemented in the corresponding software release.

- **Stagnant**: An IIP becomes stagnant if it remains inactive for one year. If the stagnation continues for two years without revival by its author, it will be withdrawn.

- **Withdrawn**: Authors may withdraw their IIPs at any time. Proposals that remain stagnant for over two years are also automatically withdrawn. Any reintroduction of such ideas must follow the full proposal process under a new IIP number.

- **Living**: Some proposals, such as IIP-1, are designed for ongoing updates and do not have a finalized state.

## Conclusion

InitVerse is still in its early development phase, but it is committed to building enterprise-grade infrastructure for the Web3 ecosystem. This improvement protocol serves as a tool to synchronize communications and foster collaboration among all members of the InitVerse community—including developers, miners, users, token holders, ecosystem partners, and more—to contribute toward the shared goal of accelerating InitVerse’s growth and success.
